# NeuroKey — Design Audit Report (Phase 0)

**Date:** 2026-09-07  
**Auditor:** Orchestrator / Architect & Security Engineer  
**Scope:** Complete cross-audit of 8 prototype screens (`code.html` as ground truth, `screen.png` as visual reference) against `sentinel_core/DESIGN.md`.

---

## Executive Summary

The prototype export contains 8 screens defining an offline-capable, local-first password and digital card vault. A rigorous review comparing `screen.png` visual mockups and `code.html` DOM/CSS implementations revealed multiple divergence points between the design specification (`sentinel_core/DESIGN.md`), the frontmatter tokens, and the practical implementation across screens. 

Notably:
1. `edit_password/screen.png` was exported as a corrupted/blank 4KB black image; however, `edit_password/code.html` is complete and fully functional (267 lines of code).
2. The brand identity drifted across three names: "Sentinel Core" (frontmatter metadata), "NeuroKey" (on-screen hero logo, typography, and storage keys), and "VaultX" (host folder name).
3. `DESIGN.md` frontmatter defines a pastel M3 token scheme (`primary: #bec6e0`, `secondary: #a9c7ff`), whereas the actual screens consistently utilize a deep OLED dark palette (`#020617` / `#000000`) with high-contrast electric blue (`#0080ff` / `#0088ff`) and purple gradient accents.
4. Component geometry across screens utilizes fully-rounded pills (`rounded-full`, `rounded-2xl`, `rounded-[32px]`), diverging from the frontmatter's default `rounded: 0.5rem (8px)`.

## Detailed Screen-by-Screen Audit

### Screen 1: Login / Sign Up (`login_sign_up`)
- **Purpose & User Flow:** Cold-start gateway gating access to the encrypted vault. Supports dual modes via segmented tab switcher: "Log In" (Email, Master Password, Biometric unlock, Forgot Password trigger) and "Sign Up" (Email, Master Password, Confirm Password, Account creation).
- **Layout & Structure:**
  - Vertically centered card container on deep dark background (`bg-background` `#101415`).
  - Hero header with lock avatar (`lock_person`) displaying a dynamic gradient (`linear-gradient(135deg, #0088ff, #a855f7)`) and stylized wordmark **NeuroKey** (`linear-gradient(90deg, #0088ff, #a855f7)`).
  - Tagline: *"Your mind, secured."*
  - Form container in elevated dark surface (`#1a1a1a`) with rounded corners (`rounded-[32px]`) and subtle border (`#2a2a2a`).
  - Segmented control pills for Log In / Sign Up (`#2a2a2a` container, `#1a1a1a` active pill).
  - Field blocks: Email, Master Password (with show/hide eye toggle), Confirm Password (in sign-up mode).
  - Main CTA: Full-width vibrant blue button (`#0088ff` / `#0080ff`, `rounded-xl`, hover transition, active scale animation).
  - Biometric quick-access block: Blue fingerprint icon (`#0088ff`, 48px) + "Tap to Unlock" action.
  - End-to-end encryption security guarantee badge in footer.
- **Colors & Tokens Actually Used in Code:**
  - Background: `#101415`
  - Container / Card: `#1a1a1a`
  - Input field fill: `#2a2a2a`
  - Border stroke: `#2a2a2a`
  - Primary Accent: `#0088ff` (Brand Blue), gradient pairing `#a855f7` (Brand Purple)
  - Success State: `#059669` / `#10b981` (Emerald 600)
  - Error State: `#ff5252` border, red-950/40 banner
  - Typography: Hanken Grotesk (Headline), Inter (Body, Buttons), JetBrains Mono (Labels)
- **Discrepancies & HIG Notes:**
  - *Color Contrast:* Placeholder text `text-on-surface-variant` (`#c6c6cd`) on `#2a2a2a` inputs achieves >4.5:1 ratio (passes WCAG AA).
  - *Accessibility / Touch Targets:* Input height is ~48px; primary button is 48px; biometric target is >48x48px (meets HIG 44x44pt requirement).
  - *Validation Feedback:* Code features real-time validation with visual shake animation and red warning banners.

### Screen 2: Passwords Vault / Home (`passwords_vault`)
- **Purpose & User Flow:** Primary home dashboard displaying all stored credentials, dynamic search, category filtering, item count badge, and quick addition. Tapping any entry opens an in-place modal/sheet with full detail inspection and editing.
- **Layout & Structure:**
  - Sticky Top App Bar with bold "Passwords" title (`text-[28px]`), quick Add action button (`+` pill in `#0080ff`).
  - Search field with magnifying glass icon (`bg-[#000000]`, border `white/10`, rounded-full).
  - Horizontal scrolling category filter pills: "All", "Email", "Instagram", "Bank", "GitHub", "Entertainment" (rounded-full).
  - Item counter badge (e.g. "2 Items", "5 Items").
  - Password Entry Cards (`rounded-2xl`, `bg-[#191c1e]`, border `white/5`):
    - Leading rounded square icon (`w-14 h-14`, `#323537` bg, `#0080ff` icon: `vpn_key`, `movie`, `account_balance`, `work`, `photo_camera`).
    - Service title, username/email subtitle, relative timestamp ("Edited 10m ago").
    - Trailing disclosure chevron.
  - Floating Bottom Navigation Dock (Pill):
    - Capsule bar (`bg-[#25282a]/95`, backdrop-blur, rounded-full) containing 4 tabs: Passwords (active `#0080ff` pill), Wallet, Generator, Settings.
  - Embedded Detail & Edit Sheet: Includes credential copy actions, unmask toggle, breach health badge, URL launcher, notes, and Delete Password button.
- **Colors & Tokens Actually Used in Code:**
  - Background: `#020617` (Deepest Slate Navy)
  - Card Surface: `#191c1e`
  - Icon container: `#323537`
  - Primary Blue: `#0080ff`
  - Text: `#ffffff` (Heading), `#a0a5aa` / `#c6c6cd` (Muted/Subtitles)
  - Health Banner: Emerald green (`bg-emerald-950/40`, border `emerald-500/20`, text `emerald-400`)
- **Discrepancies & HIG Notes:**
  - The background is explicitly `#020617` (rich black/navy), distinct from `DESIGN.md`'s `#101415`.
  - The floating bottom navigation dock floats 24px above the bottom; must ensure proper `SafeArea` padding on iOS/Android home indicators.

---

### Screen 3: Add Password (`add_password`)
- **Purpose & User Flow:** Modal/form screen allowing creation of a new password record, category selection, password generation via an interactive gesture slider ("Swipe to Create"), and notes capture.
- **Layout & Structure:**
  - Top Navigation Bar: "Cancel" (left, blue text), "Add Password" (centered bold), "Save" (right, blue bold text).
  - Category Picker: Section title "CHOOSE CATEGORY", active glyph circular indicator (`#active-icon-badge`), horizontal scrollable pill chips ("General", "Email", "Instagram", "Google", "Bank", "GitHub", "Entertainment", "+ Add Category").
  - Form Section 1 (Identity): Grouped rounded container (`bg-vaultSurface` `#191d20`) with dividers between Name, Username, and Email.
  - Form Section 2 (Password & Generator Slider):
    - Masked password input with eye toggle.
    - Interactive "Swipe to Create Password" slider track (`h-12`, `rounded-full`, bg `#101415`, border `#262b30`, animated shimmer text, draggable `#0080ff` thumb with `auto_awesome` spark icon).
  - Form Section 3 (Metadata): URL field (monospace font), Notes multiline field, category confirmation badge (`• General`).
- **Colors & Tokens Actually Used in Code:**
  - Background: `#050708` (`vaultDark`)
  - Input container: `#191d20` (`vaultSurface`), dividers `#262b30`
  - Accent: `#0080ff` (`vaultAccent`), hover `#006ee0`
  - Muted labels: `#8b949e`, `#a0aab4`
  - Shimmer text: linear gradient animation (`rgba(139,148,158,0.7)` to `rgba(255,255,255,0.95)`)
- **Discrepancies & HIG Notes:**
  - Uses custom color alias prefix `vault*` (`vaultDark`, `vaultNavy`, `vaultSurface`, `vaultAccent`) rather than standard Tailwind or `DESIGN.md` names.
  - "Swipe to Create" is a custom gesture control; HIG requires both gesture and accessible tap alternatives (which the JS script implements via thumb click).

---

### Screen 4: Edit Password / View Credential (`edit_password`)
- **Purpose & User Flow:** Detailed credential inspector and editor. Provides read-only security view by default (with instant copy triggers and eye-unmasking) and a toggled "Edit" mode allowing live inline editing and record deletion.
- **Layout & Structure:**
  - Top Bar: Circular Close button (`w-10 h-10`, bg `#1c1d22`), "Edit" / "Done" stateful action button (`#0080ff` transitioning to `#34d399` emerald in edit mode).
  - Service Identity: Large circular avatar (`w-20 h-20`, `#828690`/80) with dynamic first-letter monogram ("E"), editable Service Name title, subtitle username.

  - Danger: `#ef4444`, text `#ff453a`
  - Safety badge: `#0a1f14` bg, `emerald-500/70` border, `emerald-400` icon
- **Discrepancies & HIG Notes:**
  - **Critical Asset Discrepancy:** `edit_password/screen.png` is an unrendered 4KB black file. However, `edit_password/code.html` is 100% complete and matches the inline modal in `passwords_vault`.
  - In edit mode, inputs change from borderless readonly text to styled inputs (`bg-[#1f2128]`, border `white/10`, `rounded-lg`).

---

### Screen 5: Password Generator (`password_generator`)

    - Dynamic strength label directly below ("Strong" in `#10b981`, "Medium" in `#f59e0b`, "Weak" in `#ef4444`).
    - Action Controls: Circular reload button (`w-14 h-14`, `#272a2c` bg, `#0080ff` icon) + Wide pill Copy button (`bg-[#0080ff]`, `h-14`, `rounded-full`).
  - Dual Controls Section:
    - Left Panel: 4 toggle rows (Uppercase A-Z, Lowercase a-z, Numbers 0-9, Symbols !@#$%^&*) with iOS-style pill switches (`peer-checked:bg-[#0080ff]`).
    - Right Panel: Custom vertical "ruler/ladder" slider widget (`w-[68px]`, bg `#0c0e10`, ruler tick rungs, glowing blue slider thumb `#0080ff`, supports drag, wheel scroll, and direct tap).
  - Floating Bottom Navigation Dock: Generator tab active.
- **Colors & Tokens Actually Used in Code:**
  - Base: `#101415`
  - Card: `#191c1e`, Border: `#232729`
  - Track background: `#0c0e10`
  - Accent: `#0080ff` with glow shadow `rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.35)`
